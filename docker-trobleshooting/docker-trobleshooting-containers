					DOCKER TROUBLESHOOTING CONTAINERS : -----


Docker troubleshooting containers is THREE (3) TYPES : 

1.  docker logs <container name> --------> The docker logs command retrieves logs generated by a Docker container. It is used to inspect the output and debug applications running within containers. The basic syntax is docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER, where CONTAINER can be the container's name or ID. [manaku em ayeena error vastey dhani detail ga check cheyadanike logs use chestam....]

2.  docker exec -it <container name> <command> docker exec -it ( Container ) ls/sh/log/bash/cat --------> Docker exec is a command-line tool that allows users to run commands inside a Docker container. This tool provides a way to interact with a running container, allowing users to execute commands as if they were inside the container itself.

3.  docker rename <old_container_name> <new_container> [ docker rename Israyal Nani ] old container name changes { the container name is Nani }

4. WHAT IS ENTRYPOINT : In Docker, ENTRYPOINT defines the main command that will be executed when a container starts. It specifies the executable that runs as the container's process. Unlike CMD, which can be overridden, ENTRYPOINT ensures that the defined command always runs, even if arguments are provided during docker run. It's useful for creating containers that function as standalone executables, ensuring consistent behavior.

5. RESTART PILICIES : 4 types there are,

(1) no : the default behaviour is to not start containers automatically.

(2) always : always restart a stopped container unless the container was stopped explicitl --->[ docker run --name always-policy --restart always alpine sleep 10] 10 sec ke restart avuthundhi.
 
(3) unless-stopped : restart the container unless the container was in stopped state before the docker deamon was stopped. ...>docker run --name unless-stopped --restart unless-stopped sleep 10[ automatic stopped by a container restart with unless ]

(4) on-failure : restart the container if it exited with non-zero exit code or if the docker daemon restart. [ docker run --name unless-stopped --restart on-failure sleep 10] only failure ayenapudey matramey restart avuthundhi.
