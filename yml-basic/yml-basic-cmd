WHAT IS YAML OR YML ?
						_____________________________________

1. YAML ( YAML Ain't Markup language ) is a human-readable data serialization format.
2. it is commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between system.
3. YAML is designed to be easy to read and write, making it popular among developers and system administrators.

SYNTAX :-- YAML uses indentation and colons to structure data. YAML uses indentation to indicate the nesting of elements. space are recommended over tabs; and the number of spaces for indentation should be consistent throughout the file. conventionally, two space are used for indentation.

 key: value

 nested_key:

    - item1
    - item2

						
SYNTAX COMMINTS : Comments in YAML start with the # character and are used to provide explanatory or descriptive text. Comments are ignored by the YAML parser.

# this is a commnet
key: value #this is another comment 

SCALARS :----> scalers represent simple values like strings, numbers, Booleans and null. scalars don't have any indentation and can be expressed directly.

string_key: HELO, WORLD!
number_key: 07
boolean_key: true
null_key: null 

LISTS :---- Lists are represented by using a hyphen (-) followed by a space. lists can contain any combination of scalar, other lists or mapping (key-value pairs).

list_key:
  
  - item1

  - item2				(multiple values used by a lists)

  - sub_lists:
      
      - sub_item1
      - sub_item2

MAPPINGS : ---> Mappings represent key_value pairs and use a colon (:) to separate the key from the value. Mappings can be nested within each other.

person:

  name: israyal

  age: 23


MULTILINE SCALARS : If scalar value spans multiple lines, you can use the | character  to indicate a literal block scalar or > character to indicate a folded scalar.

multiline_key:

  this is a
 
  multiline 
  
  scalar value
